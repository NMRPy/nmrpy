# NMRpy data model

Python object model specifications based on the [md-models](https://github.com/FAIRChemistry/md-models) Rust library. The NMRpy data model is designed to store both raw and processed NMR data, as well as the parameters used for processing. As NMRpy is primarily used for the analysis of time-course data, often for determining (enzyme) kinetics, the data model is designed for maximum compatibility with the [EnzymeML](https://enzymeml.github.io/services/) standard, which provides a standardised data exchange format for kinetics data from biocatalysis, enzymology, and beyond. Therefore, relevant fields that are mandatory in the EnzymeML standard are also mandatory in this NMRpy data model.

## Core objects

### NMRpy

Root element of the NMRpy data model. Following the specifications of the EnzymeML standard, the `datetime_created` field is mandatory. Since each NMRpy instance is meant to hold a single experiment (e.g., one time-course), the data model reflects this by only allowing a single `experiment` object.

- __datetime_created__
  - Type: string
  - Description: Date and time this dataset has been created.
- datetime_modified
  - Type: string
  - Description: Date and time this dataset has last been modified.
- experiment
  - Type: [Experiment](#experiment)
  - Description: Experiment object associated with this dataset.

### Experiment

Container for a single NMR experiment (e.g., one time-course), containing one or more FID objects in the `fid_array` field. Following the specifications of the EnzymeML standard, the `name` field is mandatory.

- __name__
  - Type: string
  - Description: A descriptive name for the overarching experiment.
- fid_array
  - Type: [FIDObject](#fidobject)
  - Description: List of individual FidObjects.
  - Multiple: True

### FIDObject

Container for a single NMR spectrum, containing both raw data with relevant instrument parameters and processed data with processing steps applied. The `raw_data` field contains the complex spectral array as unaltered free induction decay from the NMR instrument. Every processing step is documented in the `processing_steps` field, together with any relevant parameters to reproduce the processing. Therefore, and to minimize redundancy, only the current state of the data is stored in the `processed_data` field. The `peaks` field is a list of `Peak` objects, each representing one single peak in the NMR spectrum.

- raw_data
  - Type: string
  - Description: Complex spectral data from numpy array as string of format `{array.real}+{array.imag}j`.
  - Multiple: True
- processed_data
  - Type: string, float
  - Description: Processed data array.
  - Multiple: True
- nmr_parameters
  - Type: [Parameters](#parameters)
  - Description: Contains commonly-used NMR parameters.
- processing_steps

  - Description: Contains the processing steps performed, as well as the parameters used for them.
- peaks
  - Type: [Peak](#peak)
  - Description: Container holding the peaks found in the NMR spectrum associated with species from an EnzymeML document.
  - Multiple: True
